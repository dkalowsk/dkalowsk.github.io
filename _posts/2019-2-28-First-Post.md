title: Attempting GitHub Pages First Post
---

Giving GitHub's Pages a try with a Jekyll "blog" service.

What to expect from this?

Basically this will be a more public version of my development notebook I use.
Expect there to be typos, incorrect information, evolving posts as I work
through events, and hopefully something useful.

None of what is posted should be read as an endorsement by or thoughts of my
employer.  That should go without saying, but to make it explicitly clear all
posts are my own.

Consume at your own peril.
